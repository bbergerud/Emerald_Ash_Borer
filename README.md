# Emerald_Ash_Borer
Agent-based modeling of the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer in Cedar Rapids using the Julia programming language.

A summary of my work can be found in my [final paper](./reports/GEOG_3520_Project_Paper.pdf) and my [presentation slides](./reports/pptx_slides.pdf). Note that I wasn't able to make the Cedar Rapids tree inventory available to the public, so it is not included in this repository.
